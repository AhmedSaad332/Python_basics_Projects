## 🚀 Topics Covered

### 1️⃣ Python Basics ( Done ) 
Learn the core building blocks of Python:
- Variables, Data Types, and Operators
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions (arguments, return values, recursion)
- File Handling
- Exception Handling
- Modules & Packages

📌 **Example Projects:**
- Calculator  
- Number Guessing Game  
- Simple File Reader  

---

### 2️⃣ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) ( in process )
Understand how Python supports **modular and reusable code**:
- Classes & Objects
- Constructors & Destructors
- Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction
- Magic / Dunder Methods (`__init__`, `__str__`, etc.)
- Composition vs Inheritance
- OOP Design Principles

📌 **Example Projects:**
- Bank Account System  
- Library Management System  
- Student Management Program  

---

### 3️⃣ Data Structures (DS) ( Future Work )
Dive into how Python manages data efficiently:
- Arrays & Lists
- Stacks & Queues
- Linked Lists (Singly, Doubly, Circular)
- Trees (Binary Tree, BST)
- Graphs (Adjacency List, Matrix)
- Hashing (Dictionaries, Hash Maps)
- Sets & Tuples

📌 **Example Projects:**
- Stack Implementation (Push/Pop)  
- Queue using Linked List  
- Binary Search Tree Operations  
- Graph Traversals (DFS, BFS)  

---

### 4️⃣ Algorithms ( Future Work )
Explore fundamental algorithms for **problem solving**:
- Searching (Linear, Binary Search) 
- Sorting (Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick, Heap Sort)
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms
- Dynamic Programming (Fibonacci, Knapsack, etc.)
- Graph Algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall, Kruskal, Prim)
- String Algorithms (Pattern Matching, Anagram Checker)

📌 **Example Projects:**
- Sorting Visualizer  
- Shortest Path Finder  
- Dynamic Programming Solutions
